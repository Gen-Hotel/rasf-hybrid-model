# Metabolic Reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: a Hybrid Modeling Approach

## Scope

This repository summarizes all the codes and data used to generate the results presented in [Metabolic Reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: a Hybrid Modeling Approach, Aghakhani et al. (2022)](https://www.makeareadme.com/). 
Please refer to the latter for all information concerning the methods used.

This repository includes:

- RASF-model's statistical analysis, i.e. cellular-specificity assessment and annotation score calculation;
- Framework for hybrid modeling, i.e. value propagation, regulatory trap-spaces identification and projection on metabolic compounds, extraction of metabolic fluxes constraints and subsequent Flux Balance Analysis;
- Regulatory initial conditionâ€™s knock-out/knock-in simulations.
