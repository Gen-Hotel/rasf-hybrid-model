# Metabolic Reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: a Hybrid Modeling Approach

## Scope

This repository summarizes all the codes and data used to generate the results presented in [Metabolic Reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: a Hybrid Modeling Approach, Aghakhani et al. (2022)](https://www.makeareadme.com/). 

Please refer to the latter for all information concerning the methods used.

This repository includes:

1.  RASF-model's statistical analysis:

- Cellular-specificity assessment;
- Annotation score calculation.

2. Framework for hybrid modeling:

- Value propagation;
- Regulatory trap-spaces identification;
- Regulatory trap-spaces projection on metabolic compounds;
- Extraction of metabolic fluxes constraints;
- Flux Balance Analysis.

3. Regulatory initial conditionâ€™s knock-out/knock-in simulations.
